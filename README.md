# UFC Fight webscraping and analysis of 'MMA Math'

This is just an initial draft and data exploration. The Fightdata repo is the final repo.
Uses Python's Pandas, BeautifulSoup and Requests.

Run the fight scraper if csv isnt current. Last updated **17/02/21**.

Future plans:
 - remove from notebook form, add requirements.txt
 - create update function to avoid running the whole fight scraper to update the data.
 - create relational database containing fight data with more fields such as method of win, fight time, sig strikes and fighter metrics.


The aim of this project is to answer the question "How often can does **'MMA math' work in the UFC?"**

More specifically the question is asking, "Do mma matches exhibit a transitive property". Moreover, if
**A,B & C** are fighters and **A>B** indicates that **A** defeated **B**, then how often is the following logic consistent:

**A>B** and **B>C** does that mean **A>C**?

If **A>C**, then MMA math 'works' for this particular case and vice versa.

**fightscraper.ipynb** contains the code to scrape the fight data using the BeautifulSoup and Requests packages.
**MMAMath1.ipynb** contains the code which transforms fightscraper data, finds all fight sequences and calculates the final ratio.

To get a quantitative answer, ufc fight data is collected and a ratio of of **(mma math works)/(total 3 fight sequences)**
is calculated.

The steps involved are as follows:
1. Using python's BeautifulSoup and Requests packages, scrape ufcstats.com to obtain a dataset of all past mma fights
and export the dataframe to a csv.
2. Load and transform the data into a dictionary of fights for each ufc fighter using Pandas library.
3. Create an algorithm that finds all possible 3 fight sequences where fighters A,B & C have fought eachother.
4. Determine percentage of fights where the transitive property holds

Current ratio **0.8125 = (mma math works)/(total 3 fight sequences)**

This means that if you predicted the outcome of a fight based on MMA math logic then you would be right 81.25% of the time.

Code does not need to be adjusted each time more fights are added to the website.

**ERROR WARNING**
If code is run during the timeslot of a new UFC fight, the data tags will be slightly different as some of the fights
will have blank fields for the results on the website, this will generate an error. Just wait until or check that an event is over before the code is run.
